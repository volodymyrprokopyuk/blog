<h1 id="state-manipulation-vs-value-calculation-in-programming">State manipulation vs value calculation in programming</h1>
<p>The main idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) is state manipulation.
Alternatively the main idea of functional programming (FP) is value calculation.
The difference between these programming paradigms from the point of view of
state mutation and value calculation is explained below. The operation of
assignment and state mutation from OOP is compared to the operation of binding
and value calculation from FP.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-programming-">What is programming?</h2>
<p><strong>Programming</strong> at the most basic level is <strong>the art of giving instructions to
the machine</strong> to be executed. This definition is very basic but it clearly
defines the essence of programming. There is some instruction set that the
machine understands and is capable of execute. The programming consists in
assembling these instructions into correct sequence in order to achieve the
desired result.</p>
<p>The machine instruction set and the language constructs are limited and finit.
But the possibilities of programming are endless. The point is that there are
many different methods to combine the machine instructions and the language
constructs. The diversity of programming methods results in variety of
programming paradigms. The main programming paradigms are object-oriented
programming and functional programming. The essential difference between these
programming paradigms is how the state manipulation and value calculation is
performed.</p>
<h2 id="state-manipulation">State manipulation</h2>
<p>Programming as the art of giving instructions to the machine can be centered
around <strong>state manipulation</strong>. <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong> broadly applies
state manipulation techniques. A program starts with some initial state
predefined in the code or configured externally. Than the program <strong>executes
statements</strong> and changes the state of entities modeled in the program. Each
statement defines the transition from one entity state to another. So the whole
program can be represented as a sequence of entity <strong>state transitions</strong>. At the
end of the program execution all entities are drawn to the desired final state.</p>
<p>The entity state is represented in a program as objects in memory. In order to
change the entity state it is necessary to change these objects in memory. This
change can be done by the entity itself or by other entities in the program. So
the entity has <strong>shared mutable state</strong> that changes over time as program
executes. The operation of state mutation in programming is called
<strong>assignment</strong>. An assignment of a value to a variable updates the variable
memory with the new value. The assignment of a value to a variable is denoted as
follows: <code>variable = value</code>. The assignment means that at some point in time
during the program execution the variable memory will hold the assigned
value. It is very important to state that the same variable can hold different
values during its lifetime, hence the name variable. That is the value of a
variable is changing over time and there is no guarantee that the variable will
hold some particular value at some particular point in time as other assignment
operations can change the value of the variable.</p>
<p>An example of state manipulation program:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let arr = []; // initial state
for(let i = 0; i &lt;= 5; ++i) {
  arr.push(i * 10); // state manipulation operation
}
// arr =&gt; [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
</code></pre>
<p>The program is composed of statements that mutate variables <code>arr</code> and <code>i</code>. The
variables <code>arr</code> and <code>i</code> are <strong>modified in place</strong> and change over time until get
to the final result. So there is state transition sequence that lead to the
final result.</p>
<h2 id="value-calculation">Value calculation</h2>
<p>Programming as the art of giving instructions to the machine can also be
centered around <strong>value calculation</strong>. <strong>Functional programming</strong> broadly
applies value calculation techniques.  The purpose of a program is to calculate
the final value from the initial one passing through intermediate value
calculations. A program starts with some initial value and <strong>applies
expressions</strong> in sequence to the initial and intermediate values in order to get
the final result. The output of the previous expression is the input for the
next expression and so on until the final result. So the whole program is a
sequence of <strong>value transformations</strong>. At the end of the program execution the
desired final value is calculated.</p>
<p>The program execution can be represented as a sequence of initial, intermediate
and final values. Each value is allocated in different memory location. Once
assigned the value does not change in time because there is no update operation,
only new value creation operation. So the program has <strong>immutable values</strong> that
do not change over time. To differentiate the operation of one-time assignment
without update from regular assignment with update the term <strong>binding</strong> is
used. When binding a value to a variable the variable is called binding and not
variable any more. The operation of binding binds a binding to a value and from
now on the value of the binding cannot be changed. The notation of a binding is
the same as the notation of assignment: <code>binding = value</code>. The point here is
that the value of binding is guaranteed to be the same during the program
execution which is not true for an assignment. Immutable values make it easier
to reason about a program and to write reliable code.</p>
<p>An example of value calculation program equivalent to the above discussed
program:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-elixir">l = 0..5 |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;(&amp;1 * 10))
# l =&gt; [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
</code></pre>
<p>The program is composed of expressions. The output of the previous expression is
the input to the next expression. So there is value transformation sequence that
lead to the final result. There is no state manipulation. The binding <code>l</code> is
bound to the final result of the composed expression and <strong>never changes in
time</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Programming is the art of giving instructions to the machine.  Programming can
be centered around state manipulation. In this case a program consist of a
sequence of statements and assignments over shared mutable state that defines
state transitions that leads to the final result.  Alternatively programming can
be centered around value calculation. In this case a program is a composition of
expressions and bindings over immutable values that defines value
transformations that leads to the final result. The value calculation approach
is easy to reason about, leads to reliable code and is used in functional
programming.</p>
