<h2 id="statements">Statements</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is centered around class definition, object
instantiation, state mutation and method invocation operations. All these
operations are expressed in object-oriented languages using statements. A
<strong>statement</strong> is an operation description that usually implies <strong>state
mutation</strong>. Object-oriented program consists of a <strong>sequence of statements</strong>
that are executed in order. Program statemens mutate program state and draw
program execution to the desired program state that represents the final result
of the program.</p>
<p>The effect of statement execution is state mutation. Statement does not return
any value but mutates program state. In the following examples the state
mutation nature of statements is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment statement</strong> assigns a value to a variable and may return the
assigned value:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let count = 0;
// count =&gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>When assignment statement is executed the variable <code>count</code> is updated with a new
value. Assignment statement can be executed many times with the same variable
and each time the variable will be updated with a new value. This proves the
state mutation nature of assignment statement.</p>
<p><strong>Conditional statement</strong> executes one set of statements or another set of
statements depending on some condition:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let count = 0;
let message = &#39;&#39;;
if (count === 0) {
  message = &#39;No items&#39;;
} else {
  message = `${count} items`;
}
// message =&gt; No items
</code></pre>
<p>Conditional statement checks the value of <code>count</code> variable and executes
an assignment statement with corresponding message. The assignment statement
mutates program state. There is no return value from a conditional statement
only program state mutation.</p>
<p><strong>Looping statement</strong> executes repeatedly a set of statements mutating the
looping variable and program state:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let arr = [];
for (let count = 0; count &lt;= 5; ++count) {
  arr.push(count * 10);
}
// arr =&gt; 0 10 20 30 40 50
</code></pre>
<p>Looping statement mutates the statet of a variable <code>count</code> and executes
<code>arr</code> mutation statement multiple times. There is no return value from looping
statement only program state mutation.</p>
<p>The essence of statement execution is program state mutation. Statement
execution produces side effects. <strong>Side effect</strong> is program state mutation as a
consequence of estatement execution. So the execution of a statement changes the
program environment. <strong>Statement execution depends on program environment</strong>. The
same statement can produce different side effects depending on the environment
it is executed in.</p>
<p>For the looping statement example the program environment is <code>count</code> and <code>arr</code>
variables. If the <code>count</code> variable is only modified with the increment statement
the looping statement side effect is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let arr = [];
for (let count = 0; count &lt;= 5; ++count) {
  arr.push(count);
}
// arr =&gt; 0 10 20 30 40 50
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>count</code> variable is also modified with assignment statement within the
body of looping statement the side effect of the same looping statement is
different:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let arr = [];
for (let count = 0; count &lt;= 5; ++count) {
  arr.push(count);
  count = 6; // side effect changes program environment
}
// arr =&gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>Statements are oriented to produce side effects. Statements do not return
values. Statements side effects dependes on program environment. The above
mentioned implies that <strong>statments are not composable</strong>. Given that statements
produce side effects and depends on program environment the only way to compose
statements is using program environment. The composition of statements via
program environment is very unreliable and very dificult to reason about because
the environment is changing with the execution of each statement.</p>
<h2 id="expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p>Functional programming (FP) is centered around function definition, function
composition, function aplication and value calculation operations. All these
operations in a functional language are performed using expressions.
<strong>Expression</strong> is a programming language construct that returns a value. The
expression result value depends only on the expression parameters and does not
depend on any program state. The only result of an <strong>expression evaluation</strong> is
the value that expression evaluates to. The expression evaluation does not
mutates program state. A functional program consists of <strong>expression
compositions</strong> that are evaluated to calculate the final program result.</p>
<p>The expression evaluation does not produce side effects and does not dependes on
program environment. The expression evaluation only depends on expression
parameters. The <strong>expression evaluation is stateless</strong>. In the following
examples the stateless nature of expression is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Binding expression</strong> binds a value to a binding and returns a bound value:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-elixir">count = 0
# count =&gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>The only result of binding expression is the binding of a value to the binding
<code>count</code>. The value of the whole binding expression is the bound value. Program
environment remains unchanged. The binding expression for the <code>count</code> binding
can be executed only once for function aplication. The binding is immutable.
There is no program state mutation.</p>
<p><strong>Conditional expression</strong> evaluates one composed expression or another composed
expression based on some condition:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-elixir">count = 0
message = if count == 0 do &#39;No items&#39; else &#39;#{count} items&#39; end
# message =&gt; &#39;No items&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>The conditional expression evaluates to a value based on the <code>count</code> value. The
conditional expression evaluation does not depend on program environment nor
modifies program environment.</p>
<p><strong>Looping expression</strong> in functional language can be represented as <code>map</code>
function aplication. <code>map</code> function aplies a function to a list and produces new
list without changing the initial list:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-elixir">l = 0..5 |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;(&amp;1 * 10))
# l =&gt; [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
</code></pre>
<p>The only result of looping expression is the new list with elements that are the
result of application of the function passed to map. The initial list and
program environment remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The benefit of the fact tha expressions do not have side effects is that
exressions are referentially transparent. <strong>Referential transparency</strong> for an
expression means that any expresion can be replaced with the result it evaluates
to for a given expression parameters without changing the overall program
result. The stateless nature of expressions means that it is more easy to reason
about them.</p>
<p>Each expression returns a value. The expression returned value can be used as
input for another expression. <strong>Expressions are composable</strong>. The expression
composition allows to construct more complex functions from simple ones. The
fact the expression does not have side effects and are referentially transparent
makes it possible to construct more reliable code and build complex
funcitonality from simple well tested blocks.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Object-oriented languages mainly use statements as building block for a program
construction. Statement execution has side effects. Statements depend on program
environment and mutate program state. The program in object-oritented languages
is a sequence of assignment, conditional and looping statements that modify
program state. Statements do not return values and are not composable.</p>
<p>Functional languages use expressions as building blocks of a progarm
construction. Expression evaluation has no side effects and is referentially
transparent. Expression evaluation does not depends on program environment nor
modifies program state. The program in functional languages is a composition of
binding, conditional and looping expressions that evaluates to the final program
result. Expressions are compsable and easy to reason about.</p>
