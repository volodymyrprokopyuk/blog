<p>TODO</p>
<h2 id="imperative-style-of-programming">Imperative style of programming</h2>
<p>Imperative style of programming is a basic method of programming. The
programming began with imperative style using the assembler as programming
language. Imperative style of programming is older then decalrative style of
programming. Imperative style of programming implies the <strong>detailed step by step
instructions</strong> to the machine about how to carry out the calculations to get the
final result.</p>
<p>The instructions used in imperative style of programming are a <strong>low-level
instructions</strong>. The imperative style instruction set is very close to the
machine instruction set. The imperative style instruciton set comprises
assignment, conditional and looping instructions that are common in all
programming languages. Imperative style of programming requires <strong>explicit
definition of higher level abstractions</strong> in program construction. All
program building blocks have to be explicitly defined using low-level
imperative instructions.</p>
<p>Imperative style of programming approches the problem solution from the
perspective of <strong>do yourself heavy work</strong>. Imperative style of programming
provides only basic low-level instrucitons and gives total freedom about
what and how high-level program abstraction can be constucted. To construct
high-level abstractions it is necessary to define how exactly each and every
abstaction have to be implemented. Imperative style of programming operates in
low-level terms of <strong>how</strong>. Low-level instruction set provided by imperative
style of programming allows for great fexibility and freedom. The cost of this
flexibility and freedom are larger more verbose and more arror prone code.</p>
<p>An example of imperative style of programming is a for loop:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">let arr = [];
for (let count = 0; count &lt;= 5; ++count) {
  arr.push(count * 10);
}
// arr =&gt; 0 10 20 30 40 50
</code></pre>
<p>In order to get the final result it is necessary to control how the <code>count</code>
variable is initialized, how the <code>count</code> variable is modified and what is the
loop exit condition. The imperative programming aproch is more verbose and more
error prone.</p>
<p>An exmaple of declarative style of programming equivalent to the imperative for
loop:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-elixir">l = 0..5 |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;(&amp;1 * 10))
# l =&gt; [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
</code></pre>
<p>The final result is desribed in terms of high-level operations (range and
map). Declarative style of programming produces more reliable, less error prone
code that is easier to read, understand and reason about.</p>
<h2 id="declarative-style-of-programming">Declarative style of programming</h2>
<p>Declarative style of programming is a high-level method of programming.
Declarative style of programming is the evolution of imperative style of
programming. Declarative style of programming is younger then imperative
style of programming. The evolution of declarative style of programing means
leaving low-level programming concerns to the runtime and going towards
<strong>high-level problem concerns</strong>. Declarative style of progarmming is all
about <strong>defining conditions that final result should satisfy</strong>. Declarative
style of programming leaves all implementation details to the environment or
the runtime to deal with.</p>
<p>Declarative style of programming provides high-lever abstactions to construct
program with. Declarative programming consists in <strong>implicit use of high-level
abstactions</strong> provided by the runtime. The high-level abstractions allows to
define the conditions that the final result should satisfy. The declarative
style program is a compisition of high level abstractions that describe <strong>what</strong>
the final result is but not how to caclulate the final result. Given the
declarative style program the runtime is capable of constructing and executing
the necessary operations to calculate the final result. The final result
derivation from the declarative result description is an automatic process done
by the runtime. No explicit detailed step by step instructions are
needed. Define final result conditions in terms of high-level abstractions and
<strong>let the runtime to solve the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>The high-level abstractions provided by declartive programming are less fexible
and more reliable than low-level instructions provided by imperative
programming.  By providing high-level abstractions declarative programming
limits the capabilities and the flexibility of a program compared to an
imperative probram constructed with low-level instructions. Declarative
programming provide more reliable and dedicated environment designed to solve
a specific types of problems easily and efficiently. The declarative
programming languages designed to solve a specific types of programs are called
<strong>DSL</strong>s (Domain Spacific Languages). DSLs are an example of declarative style
of programming.</p>
<p><strong>Regular expressions</strong> is a DSL for efficient string manipulation (searching,
extraction and replacing):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const phonePage =
  `Volodymyr 123456789
   Svitlana 987654321`;
let phoneBook = [];
let r = /(\w+)\s+(\d+)/g;
let m = null;
while((m = r.exec(phonePage)) !== null) {
  phoneBook.push({name: m[1], phone: m[2]});
}
// phoneBook =&gt;
//   [{name: &#39;Volodymyr&#39;, phone: &#39;123456789&#39;},
//    {name: &#39;Svitlana&#39;, phone: &#39;987654321&#39;}]
</code></pre>
<p>The regular expression <code>/(\w+)\s+(\d+)/g</code> describes using hight level
abstractions (words, spaces and digits) what the result should be and not how to
caclulate it. Given the high-level abstract description of the desired result
the regular expressions engine performs necessary operation to parse and extract
the information. No explicit low-level instructions are involved in the process
only implicit high-level abstractions.</p>
<p><strong>SQL</strong> is a DSL for efficient relational data manipulation (inserting, updating,
retrieving and deleting):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sql">select o.order_id, p.product_id, p.name, p.price, o.quantity
from Orders o
  join Products p on p.product_id = o.product_id
where o.order_id = 1234;
</code></pre>
<p>SQL query describes in terms of high-level abstractions (relations,
intersections, projections and predicates) what conditions the retrieved
information should satisfy. All the necessary implementation details to retrieve
the desired information are handled by SQL engine.</p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong> is a DSL for efficient information representation in Internet:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Volodymyr Prokopyuk&#39;s Blog&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The HTML markup defines in terms of high-level operations (title, headers and
paragraphs) what the final page is. The browser rendering engine performs all
necessary operations to display the page as described by HTML.</p>
