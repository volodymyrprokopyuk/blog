<h2 id="imperative-style-of-programming">Imperative style of programming</h2>
<p>Imperative style of programming is the basic method of programming. The
programming began with imperative style using the assembler as programming
language. Imperative style of programming is older then decalrative style of
programming. Imperative style of programming implies the <strong>detailed step by step
instructions</strong> to the machine about how to carry out the calculations to get the
final result.</p>
<p>The instructions used in imperative style of programming are a <strong>low-level
instructions</strong>. The imperative style instruction set is very close to the
machine instruction set. The imperative style instruciton set comprises
assignment, conditional and looping instructions that are common in all
programming languages. Imperative style of programming requires <strong>explicit
definition of higher level abstractions</strong> in program construction. All
program building blocks have to be explicitly defined using low-level
imperative instructions.</p>
<p>Imperative style of programming approches the problem solution from the
perspective <strong>do yourself heavy work</strong>. Imperative style of programming
provides only basic low-level instrucitons and gives total freedom about
what and how high-level program abstraction can be constucted. To construct
high-level abstractions it is necessary to define how exactly each and every
abstaction have to be implemented. Imperative style of programming operates in
low-level terms of <strong>how</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed step by step instructions</li>
<li>Explicit</li>
<li>Do yourself heavy work</li>
<li>How</li>
<li>Examples (loop, extract)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="declarative-style-of-programming">Declarative style of programming</h2>
<p>Declarative style of programming is high-level method of programming.
Declarative style of programming is the evolution of imperative style of
programming. Declarative style of programming is younger then imperative
style of programming. The evolution of declarative style of programing is
leaving low-level programming concerns to the runtime and going towards
<strong>high-level problem concerns</strong>. Declarative style of progarmming is all
about <strong>defining conditions that final result should satisfy</strong>. Declarative
style of programming leaves all details implementation to the environment or
runtime to deal with.</p>
<p>Declarative style of programming provides high-lever abstactions to construct
program with. Declarative programming implies <strong>implicit use of high-level
abstactions</strong> provided by the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define conditions that result should satisfy</li>
<li>Implicit</li>
<li>Let the environment, the runtime to solve the problem</li>
<li>What</li>
<li>Exmaples DSL (Regex, Glob, SQL, HTML)</li>
</ul>
